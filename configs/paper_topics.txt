 1. Correlation method such as RPA (random phase approximation) and GW (Green function with screened Coulomb potential).
    - Relevant: dynamtic screened effect, self-consistent GW beyond G0W0, method to treat Gamma-point singularity. GW should be related to quasi-particle and many-body physics.
    - Not relevant: RPA is not refer to author's name.
 2. Calculation of excited state (exciton) energy and photon-absorption spectrum based on Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) or liner-response time-dependent density-functional theory (lr-TDDFT).
    - Relevant: many-body physics, Casida matrix, beyond Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), method involved finite temperature Green function and fractional occupation. Also, benchmark with wave function method like CC3 is welcomed.
 3. Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and its application.
    - Relevant: optimization of occupation number and orbital.
 4. Auxiliary basis based on resolution of identity or density fitting.
 5. The double-counting term and hybrid functional theory related to the Dynamical mean field theory.

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on new methodology, rather than just benchmark or convergence test. Most importantly, he is very interested in theory of BSE (Bethe-Salpeter equation) which can describe excitation process, so list BSE papers in priority.
