 1. New methodology of hybrid functional theory, which combines Density Functional Theory and Hartree-Fock self-consistent calculation.
    - Relevant: method about resolution of identity or density fitting
    - Not relevant: papers about adaptation to some task. Simply following instructions or inputs are not sufficient.
 2. Correlation method such as RPA and GW.
 3. Calculation of excited state (exciton) energy and photon-absorption spectrum based on Bethe-Salpeter equation or liner-response time-dependent density-functional theory (lr-TDDFT).
    - Relevant: beyond Tamm-Dancoff approximation, fractional occpuation

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on new methodology, rather than just benchmark or convergence test.
